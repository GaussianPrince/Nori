See the file `NEWS'.


3. Building Wendy
=================

If you got this source tree from a CVS repository, you will need to bootstrap
the build environment using `build/bootstrap.sh'.  Note that this script
requires autoconf and automake to run.

If (or once) you have a `configure' script, go ahead and run it.  No additional
magic should be required.  If it is, then that's a bug and should be reported.

Wendy depends on the following external libraries:

  GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  GLFW (http://glfw.sourceforge.net/)
  Moira (http://www.elmindreda.org/moira/)
  ODE
  OpenAL


4. Installing Wendy
===================

See the file `INSTALL'.


5. Using Wendy
==============

Wendy is documented using the Doxygen suite.  A suitable Doxyfile is located
in the docs/ subdirectory.


6. Hacking Wendy
