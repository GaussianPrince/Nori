Wendy library
=============

Introduction
------------

Wendy is a "game engine".  More specifically, it's a static C++ library intended
to be useful for the production of small games.  It is written and maintained by
me, elmindreda, to serve as a basis for the games I write.

Unlike most of my projects, I write Wendy primarily for own use, so while other
people may find it useful, it comes with no support and far too little
documentation.

If you like Wendy and would like to use it for your game, you should instead
most likely use [gameplay](http://www.gameplay3d.org/), which is eerily similar,
more complete _and_ actually supported.

Wendy currently lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/elmindreda/Wendy).

Wendy comes bundled with a number of dependencies, each with its own license.

Building Wendy
--------------

Wendy uses the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build system for itself and all
its dependencies.  It is available for all platforms supported by the engine.

Wendy comes with internal versions of the following libraries:

*   [Bullet] (http://bulletphysics.org/) for dynamics and collision
*   [ENet](http://enet.bespin.org/) for UDP networking
*   [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for managing OpenGL extensions
*   [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) for OpenGL context, input and window
*   [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/) for vector math and explicitly sized types
*   [libogg](http://www.xiph.org/ogg/) for reading Ogg files
*   [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/) for reading and writing PNG files
*   [libvorbis](http://xiph.org/vorbis/) for decoding Vorbis audio data
*   [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/) for regular expression support
*   [pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) for reading and writing XML files
*   [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/) for embedded scripting
*   [zlib](http://zlib.net/) for compressed data streams

Wendy requires that OpenGL and OpenAL headers and link libraries are present in
your development environment.

On Debian GNU/Linux based systems, where GLFW also needs Xlib, the following
packages provide the necessary support:

*   `xorg-dev`
*   `libopenal-dev`
*   `libgl1-mesa-dev`

On other Linux distributions, there will most likely be similarly named packages
available.

On Mac OS X, OpenGL and OpenAL is already built-in.

On Windows, OpenGL headers and link libraries should be provided by your
compiler.  For OpenAL, you will need to install an OpenAL SDK.


Using Wendy
-----------

Wendy is (partially) documented using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/).
A suitable `Doxyfile` will be generated by CMake in the `docs/` subdirectory.

The audio system requires OpenAL 1.1.  No extensions are used.

The render system requires OpenGL 3.2.  The following OpenGL extensions are not
required, but used where available:

*   `GL_ARB_texture_float`
*   `GL_ARB_half_float_pixel`
*   `GL_ARB_debug_output`
*   `GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic`


Questions, patches and other feedback
-------------------------------------

I will answer questions mailed to me, but please keep in mind that my time is
limited.  Bug reports, patches and pull requests are also welcome, but I cannot
_guarantee_ that your change will be accepted.
