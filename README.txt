Wendy library
=============

0. Introduction
===============

Wendy is a C++ library intended to be useful for the production of small games.

The project website is here:

  http://www.elmindreda.org/wendy/

Wendy resides in a public monotone repository on mtn.elmindreda.org.  The main
(and the only usable) branch is org.elmindreda.wendy .


1. License and copyright
========================

Wendy is copyright (c) 2004 Camilla Berglund <elmindreda@elmindreda.org>

Wendy is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.  See `COPYING.txt' for license
details.  The license is also included at the top of each source file.

Wendy comes bundled with a number of dependencies, each with its own license.
See the respective `libs/*/COPYING.txt' file for license details.


2. Building Wendy
=================

Wendy uses the CMake build system, which is available on most Unix-like
operating systems, and for which there are windows binaries on their site:

  CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) for building Wendy and its dependencies

Wendy comes with internal versions of the following libraries:

  expat (http://expat.sourceforge.net/) for reading XML files
  libpng (http://www.libpng.org/) for reading and writing PNG files
  libogg (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/) for reading Ogg files
  libvorbis (http://xiph.org/vorbis/) for decoding Vorbis audio data
  PCRE (http://www.pcre.org/) for regular expression support
  zlib (http://zlib.net/) for compressed data streams
  GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/) for managing OpenGL extensions
  GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/) for OpenGL context, input and window
  GLM (http://glm.g-truc.net/) for vector math and explicitly sized types

Wendy depends on the availability of OpenGL 2.0 and OpenAL 1.1.

On Debian GNU/Linux based systems, where GLFW also needs Xlib, the following
packages provide the necessary support:

  xorg-dev
  libopenal-dev
  libgl1-mesa-dev
  libglu1-mesa-dev

Other Linux systems and other Unix-like systems, there will most likely be
similarly named packages available.

On Mac OS X, OpenGL and OpenAL is already built-in.

On Windows, OpenGL headers and link libraries should be provided by your
compiler.  For OpenAL, you will need to install the OpenAL SDK.


3. Using Wendy
==============

Wendy is documented using the Doxygen suite.  A suitable Doxyfile will be
generated by CMake in the docs/ subdirectory.


4. Hacking Wendy
================

Sorry, you're on your own for now.
